# Godot First Project

This is my first project on godot. It's a simple 2D game with no end. You just walk and kill slimes all over the map. To make this project i have used only the [ documentation](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable). Of course it has a lot of bugs and there is not much to do, but that's just a first try of godot  to improve my game development knowledge and skills.
